Terminology

handler  
    Placeholder object which contains traps.
traps  
    The methods that provide property access. This is analogous to the concept of traps in operating systems.
target  
    Object which the proxy virtualizes. It is often used as storage backend for the proxy. 
    Invariants (semantics that remain unchanged) regarding object non-extensibility or non-configurable 
    properties are verified against the target.

### Virtual DOM vs Shadow DOM
Vue.js and React both use Virtual DOM so it is a known concept by many but often it is confused with Shadow Dom. ...  

Shadow DOM refers to the ability of the browser to include a subtree of DOM elements into the rendering of a document,  
but not into the main document DOM tree.

### Life Cycle Hooks 
a function that runs within a specific time frame  
Each Vue instance goes through a series of initialization steps when itâ€™s created - for example, it needs to set up data observation, compile the template, mount the instance to the DOM, and update the DOM when data changes. Along the way, it also runs functions called lifecycle hooks, giving users the opportunity to add their own code at specific stages.
